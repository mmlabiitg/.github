We are a research group at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) headed by Dr. Arijit Sur. Our research is mainly focused on Deep Learning approaches to solve different Computer Vision problems like image, video restoration, under water vision, super-resolution, satellite image segmentation, image translation, image steganalysis, zero shot learning, adversarial perturbation etc. Beside computer vision problems, our group also explores different ML based approaches for adaptive video streaming in 5G environment. Currently five research scholars, five masterâ€™s students and four under graduate students are working in the lab. We have published 23 journal papers and more than 50 conference papers in different premium journals and conferences.
